# Chart Data Representation Fix

## Issue Identified
Charts were not properly displaying all entries due to several data processing issues:

1. **Duplicate Line Chart Data**: Both line series in Dashboard.tsx and SCADADashboard.tsx were showing the same `d.recycled` data instead of distinct datasets.
2. **Incorrect Today's Metrics**: The `convertEntriesToDashboardData()` method was using total values from all entries and labeling them as "today's" values instead of calculating actual daily metrics.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Line Chart Data Correction
**Files Modified**: `Dashboard.tsx`, `SCADADashboard.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
series={[
  {
    data: displayData?.historicalData?.map((d: HistoricalDataPoint) => d.recycled) || [],
    label: `Waste Input - Recyclable (${units})`,
    color: '#81C784'
  },
  {
    data: displayData?.historicalData?.map((d: HistoricalDataPoint) => d.recycled) || [], // DUPLICATE!
    label: `Recycled Materials (${units})`,
    color: '#4CAF50'
  }
]}
```

**After:**
```typescript
series={[
  {
    data: displayData?.historicalData?.map((d: HistoricalDataPoint) => d.recycled) || [],
    label: `Recyclable Materials (${units})`,
    color: '#4CAF50'
  },
  {
    data: displayData?.historicalData?.map((d: HistoricalDataPoint) => d.waste) || [], // FIXED!
    label: `Non-Recyclable Waste (${units})`,
    color: '#FF7043'
  }
]}
```

### 2. Today's Metrics Calculation Fix
**File Modified**: `dataManager.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Incorrectly used totals from ALL entries as "today's" values
const totalRecycled = entries.filter(entry => entry.isRecyclable).reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.weight, 0);
const totalNonRecyclable = entries.filter(entry => !entry.isRecyclable).reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.weight, 0);

realTimeMetrics: {
  todayRecycled: totalRecycled,    // WRONG - this is total, not today
  todayWaste: totalNonRecyclable,  // WRONG - this is total, not today
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Correctly calculate today's specific values
const today = new Date();
const todayStart = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate());
const todayEntries = entries.filter(entry => new Date(entry.timestamp) >= todayStart);

const todayRecycled = todayEntries
  .filter(entry => entry.isRecyclable)
  .reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.weight, 0);
const todayWaste = todayEntries
  .filter(entry => !entry.isRecyclable)
  .reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.weight, 0);

realTimeMetrics: {
  todayRecycled: todayRecycled,    // CORRECT - actual today's recycled
  todayWaste: todayWaste,          // CORRECT - actual today's waste
}
```

## Impact of Fixes

### ✅ **Charts Now Properly Display**:
1. **Line Charts**: Show two distinct data series (recyclable vs non-recyclable materials) instead of duplicate data
2. **Historical Trends**: Accurately reflect daily variations in both recyclable and non-recyclable waste
3. **Today's Metrics**: Show actual daily totals instead of all-time totals mislabeled as "today"
4. **Pie Charts**: Continue to show all recyclable category breakdowns correctly
5. **Time Range Filtering**: Works properly with accurate historical data generation

### ✅ **Entry Representation**:
- **All Entries Included**: Category totals calculated from all entries regardless of time range
- **Proper Time Filtering**: Historical charts filter by selected time range (today/3days/week)
- **Accurate Categorization**: Recyclable vs non-recyclable entries properly separated
- **Real-time Updates**: New entries immediately reflected in all visualizations

### ✅ **Data Integrity**:
- **Consistent Data Sources**: All charts use the same underlying data with proper transformations
- **Accurate Calculations**: Today's metrics truly reflect daily activity
- **Proper Filtering**: Time-based filtering only applied where appropriate (historical trends)
- **Complete Representation**: No entries excluded from category breakdowns or totals

## Verification Checklist

To confirm all entries are represented:

1. **Add a new waste entry** → Should appear immediately in:
   - Category breakdown pie chart (if recyclable)
   - Today's metrics (if added today)
   - Historical trend chart (in appropriate time slot)
   - Entry list (last 3 entries shown)

2. **Switch time ranges** → Should show:
   - Different historical data periods
   - Same category totals (all-time)
   - Same overall metrics (today's remain today's)

3. **Check both dashboards** → Should display:
   - Identical data representations
   - Proper chart series differentiation
   - Accurate metric calculations

---

**Result**: All entries are now properly represented across all graphs and visualizations in the program, with accurate data separation and time-based filtering where appropriate.
