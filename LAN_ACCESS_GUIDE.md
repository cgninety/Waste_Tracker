- ✅ System is designed for local network use only

### Network Requirements  
- ✅ All devices must be on same local network
- ✅ Router should allow device-to-device communication
- ✅ Some corporate networks may block this access

## 📋 Network Information

### How to Find Your Network IP
1. Run `start-lan.bat` - it will detect automatically
2. Or manually: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
3. Look for "IPv4 Address" that starts with:
   - 192.168.x.x (most home networks)
   - 10.x.x.x (some routers)
   - 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x (less common)

### Common Port Numbers
- Client (Web App): 3000
- Server (API): 3001
- May auto-adjust if ports are in use

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Optimal Performance
1. Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Keep all devices on same WiFi network
3. Bookmark the URL on frequently used devices
4. Close unnecessary browser tabs for better performance

### For Multiple Users
1. Share the network URL with team members
2. Each person can access simultaneously
3. Data syncs automatically across all sessions
4. No login required on local network
